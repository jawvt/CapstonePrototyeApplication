Improve UI:

####################################################
You are a senior R Shiny UI/UX engineer with experience designing modern, professional, public-facing web applications.

Create a simple, interactive, and innovative R Shiny user interface inspired by the structure and feel of modern geospatial and innovation-focused websites (e.g., Woolpert Innovations).

UI Requirements

Use fluidPage() with a clean, professional theme (light background, modern typography)

Include a hero-style landing section with a title, short subtitle, and call-to-action button

Add a top navigation bar or tab-based layout that clearly separates content sections

Sections should include:

Overview / Introduction

Interactive Map or Visualization area (placeholder OK)

Projects or Features showcase (cards or panels)

Contact or About section

Layout should feel spacious, minimal, and corporate-professional

Interactivity

Use Shiny-native interactivity (tabs, buttons, hover effects, collapsible panels)

Include placeholders for interactive content (Leaflet maps, Plotly charts, etc.)

UI should be responsive and readable on desktop and tablet

Design Expectations

Minimal color palette (1–2 accent colors)

Clear hierarchy (headline → subtext → content)

Avoid clutter and excessive controls

Use tags$div, tags$section, and CSS where appropriate

Output Instructions

change the original .R script you wrote to fit these needs

Make the text on the buttons white no matter the situation
