I am working on a project.
last week I ended my work at app_modern_1.R in the files.
I am hiring you as a master Shiny app UI developer to update my application.
I have received feedback from my client and need this app to contain less scrolling and more tab based to make is simpler for the user.
they also want to add some more vibrant earthy tones to make is more college student friendly.
Can you reference the code and help me develop this app even better
