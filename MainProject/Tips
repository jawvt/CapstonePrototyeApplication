How it looks - find the class name on the element, go to that class in app_css, edit there

What it says - find the tags$ element in the UI section, edit the text string inside it

What data it shows - find the corresponding render function in the server section

Move the CSS code into styles.css file in the www folder
then replacet ags$style(HTML(app_css)) with 
tags$link(rel = "stylesheet", href = "styles.css")
when done developing
